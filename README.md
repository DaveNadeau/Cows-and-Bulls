# Cows-and-Bulls
"Cows and Bulls" is a code breaking game similar to mastermind- except with numbers.  

This was a student project that 2 fellow students and I worked on in order to implement some basic AI.  While we did do some basic exception/error handling, it still has a few bugs and/or unintended cheats available in it.
